### **Overall Experience & Brand Perception Metrics**

These metrics measure the holistic candidate perception of your hiring process and employer brand.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Candidate Net Promoter Score (NPS)** is a powerful indicator of your employer brand's health. A candidate who had a great experience, even if rejected, can become a brand advocate; a negative experience can create a vocal critic.

> [!WARNING]
> Poor **Glassdoor/Review Site Ratings** for your interview process are a public red flag that actively deters top talent. They provide an unfiltered view of your candidate experience and must be monitored and addressed.

> [!TIP]
> **Candidate Satisfaction Score (CSAT)** provides specific feedback on the process itself. Use it to identify what you're doing well and where you need immediate improvement, such as communication or interviewer professionalism.

> [!NOTE]
> A high **Candidate Reapplication Rate** is a strong positive signal. It means your process was respectful enough that candidates are willing to go through it again, indicating strong brand loyalty and a positive experience.

### **Process Efficiency & Communication Metrics**

These metrics reveal friction points and communication gaps within the hiring workflow.

> [!CAUTION]
> A high **Application Drop-Off Rate** is a direct result of a cumbersome application process. Every required field and unnecessary click costs you qualified candidates. This is a critical bottleneck at the very top of your funnel.

> [!WARNING]
> A low **Interview Show Rate** often points to poor communication, long delays between steps, or a lack of respect for the candidate's time. This wastes recruiter and interviewer resources and signals a broken process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Response Time to Applicants** sets the tone for the entire candidate experience. A slow response, especially after an application or interview, is frequently cited as a top frustration and can cause you to lose top candidates to faster-moving competitors.

> [!TIP]
> Audit your **Communication Frequency**. Candidates should never be in the dark. Proactive, transparent communication (even to say there's no update) builds trust and maintains engagement, reducing drop-off and improving satisfaction.

### **Critical Insight & Action Metrics**

These metrics provide direct, actionable reasons behind candidate decisions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Offer Decline Reasons** are a goldmine of strategic information. They tell you exactly where you are failing to compete, whether on compensation, benefits, role scope, or your value proposition. Every declined offer should be followed by an exit interview.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Mobile Application Rate** is a baseline usability check. If a significant portion of your candidates apply via mobile, a non-mobile-friendly application process will automatically disqualify a segment of your potential talent pool.

> [!CAUTION]
> Ignoring the reasons behind **Offer Decline Reasons** and low **Interview Show Rates** means you are repeatedly making the same costly mistakes, leading to continued lost talent and increased **Cost per Hire**.
