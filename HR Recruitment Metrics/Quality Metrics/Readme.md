### **Ultimate Outcome & Impact Metrics**

These metrics define the long-term success and return on investment of your hiring process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Quality of Hire** is the ultimate measure of recruiting effectiveness. It answers the critical question: "Are we hiring the right people?" It directly impacts team performance, culture, and business results.

> [!WARNING]
> A high **First-Year Attrition Rate** is a critical failure signal. It indicates a breakdown in the hiring process (poor skills assessment, misaligned expectations) or the onboarding experience, resulting in significant wasted investment.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Regrettable vs. Non-Regrettable Turnover** is more important than overall turnover. High regrettable turnover (top performers leaving) is a severe problem, while non-regrettable turnover (low performers leaving) can be a sign of a healthy, self-correcting process.

> [!TIP]
> Track **Time to Productivity** to measure the real economic impact of your hires. A shorter time means a faster return on investment. This metric is crucial for justifying investments in better onboarding and training.

### **Early Indicator & Retention Metrics**

These metrics provide early signals of hiring success or failure, allowing for proactive intervention.

> [!WARNING]
> The **90-Day Retention Rate** is a canary in the coal mine. A low rate here strongly suggests a poor candidate experience, misrepresented role, or ineffective onboarding, demanding immediate attention.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **New Hire Performance Ratings** provide the first concrete data point on quality. Consistently low ratings from hiring managers indicate a systemic issue in your assessment of skills or capabilities during interviews.

> [!NOTE]
> **Pre-Hire Quality Score** (interview scores, assessment results) should be correlated with **New Hire Performance Ratings**. If they don't align, your pre-hire evaluation criteria are not predictive of on-the-job success and need to be revised.

### **Validation & Process Feedback Metrics**

These metrics provide qualitative and quantitative feedback to validate and improve your hiring strategy.

> [!TIP]
> **Hiring Manager Satisfaction** is a leading indicator of the recruiting team's partnership and effectiveness. Dissatisfied hiring managers will often work around the formal process, undermining your strategy.

> [!NOTE]
> **New Hire Satisfaction** scores provide direct feedback on the candidate experience and onboarding process. High satisfaction correlates with higher engagement, faster productivity, and better retention.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Offer Acceptance Quality** analysis helps you understand if you are winning the right candidates. If the candidates who accept your offers are systematically weaker than those who decline, your employer value proposition or offer competitiveness needs review.

> [!TIP]
> A high **Promotion Rate of New Hires** within the first few years is a strong long-term validation of your ability to identify high-potential talent and a key component of a strong leadership pipeline.
