### **Strategic Business Contribution Metrics**

These metrics connect talent acquisition activities directly to financial performance and business outcomes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Revenue per New Hire** is the ultimate business justification for your talent acquisition function. It quantifies the financial contribution of new employees, helping leadership view recruiting not as a cost center, but as a revenue-enabling investment.

> [!WARNING]
> **Vacancy Cost** is a often-underestimated silent profit killer. It represents the tangible loss in productivity, delayed projects, and overtime for other employees caused by every day a role remains unfilled. Reducing **Time to Fill** directly mitigates this cost.

> [!TIP]
> Calculate **Recruiting ROI** to demonstrate the value your team delivers. A positive and growing ROI justifies larger budgets, investment in new technology, and strategic initiatives by proving that the returns outweigh the costs.

### **Risk & Performance Accountability Metrics**

These metrics focus on the financial impact of hiring failures and budgetary control.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Bad Hire Cost** is a massive, multi-faceted financial drain. It includes recruitment costs, onboarding time, training expenses, severance, and the incalculable cost of missed opportunities and team disruption. Improving **Quality of Hire** is the primary way to reduce this.

> [!WARNING]
> A significant **Talent Acquisition Budget Variance** (especially overspending) without a clear link to improved business outcomes (like higher **Revenue per New Hire**) indicates poor financial management and a lack of strategic alignment, jeopardizing the function's credibility.

> [!NOTE]
> Tracking **Bad Hire Cost** makes the abstract concept of a "mis-hire" concrete and financially compelling. It builds a powerful case for investing in better assessment tools, interviewer training, and robust onboarding.
