### **Channel Strategy & Outreach Effectiveness**

These metrics evaluate the performance of your sourcing methods and outreach tactics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Sourcing Channel Effectiveness** is the cornerstone of a data-driven sourcing strategy. It combines volume, quality, and cost to tell you where to invest your time and budget for the best return.

> [!TIP]
> Track your **Active vs. Passive Candidate Ratio**. A heavy reliance on active applicants may be easier but can limit quality. A healthy pipeline of passive candidates, though harder to engage, often leads to higher-quality hires.

> [!CAUTION]
> A low **InMail/Outreach Response Rate** indicates your messaging is not resonating. This could be due to a weak employer value proposition, poorly personalized messages, or targeting the wrong talent. This wastes valuable sourcing time.

> [!NOTE]
> **Sourcing Yield Ratio** (sourced contacts â†’ interviews) measures the efficiency of your outbound efforts. A low ratio means you are contacting many people but few are qualified or interested enough to interview.

### **Pipeline Health & Proactive Strategy**

These metrics focus on building long-term talent relationships rather than just filling immediate roles.

> [!WARNING]
> Ignoring **Talent Pool Growth** and **Engagement** forces you to source from scratch for every role. This is highly inefficient and results in longer **Time to Fill**, especially for hard-to-fill positions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Talent Pool Engagement Rate** is critical. A large pool of disengaged candidates is worthless. Regular, valuable touchpoints keep your company top-of-mind and dramatically increase the conversion rate when you have an open role.

> [!TIP]
> Use **Boolean Search Effectiveness** to refine your sourcing skills. Tracking which search strings actually produce qualified, responsive candidates turns sourcing from an art into a science and improves your **Sourcing Yield Ratio**.

### **Technology & Efficiency Metrics**

These metrics gauge how effectively you are using tools to scale your sourcing efforts.

> [!NOTE]
> **Chrome Extension/Tool Usage** among your recruiting team is an indicator of efficiency and modern sourcing practices. Low adoption suggests a training gap or a preference for less efficient, manual methods.

> [!TIP]
> A growing **Talent Community** is a leading indicator of future sourcing success. It represents a marketing-qualified pipeline of candidates who have explicitly opted in to hear from you, making them much warmer leads than cold-outreach contacts.
