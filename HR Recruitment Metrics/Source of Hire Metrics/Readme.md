### **Strategic Sourcing & Channel Optimization**

These metrics guide where you invest your recruitment resources for the best return.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Source of Hire by Quality** is the most critical sourcing metric. Knowing which channels produce your *top performers* is more valuable than knowing which channels produce the *most hires*. Always pair volume with quality.

> [!TIP]
> Analyze **Source Cost Effectiveness** alongside **Source Conversion Rates**. A channel might have a low cost per application but a terrible conversion rate, making it more expensive in the long run than a channel with a higher upfront cost but better candidates.

> [!WARNING]
> Ignoring the **Agency vs. Internal Hire Ratio** can lead to runaway costs. A high reliance on agencies signals an underdeveloped internal sourcing function and is a major driver of high **Cost per Hire**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Source of Hire** (volume) provides a basic map of your hiring landscape, but it's just the starting point for deeper analysis into quality and cost.

### **High-Value Talent Channel Metrics**

These metrics focus on the most cost-effective and high-quality sources of talent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A strong **Employee Referral Rate** is often correlated with higher quality of hire, better cultural fit, and lower attrition. This is typically your most valuable source and should be actively nurtured and incentivized.

> [!TIP]
> Track your **Internal Mobility Rate** closely. Promoting from within boosts retention, morale, and reduces time-to-productivity. A low rate can indicate siloed departments or a lack of career development paths.

> [!CAUTION]
> A low **Career Site Conversion Rate** means your employer brand and candidate experience are failing at the final hurdle. You are driving traffic, but not convincing visitors to apply. This is a major missed opportunity.

### **Tactical Channel Performance Metrics**

These metrics help you evaluate the performance of specific recruitment marketing activities.

> [!NOTE]
> **Job Board Performance** should be measured not just by application volume, but by the quality and conversion rate of those applicants. Don't renew contracts with boards that only send you unqualified candidates.

> [!TIP]
> Measure **Social Media Sourcing Effectiveness** by tracking hires back to specific campaigns or profiles. Focus on platforms where your target talent is actually active, not just where it's easiest to post.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Recruiting Event ROI** is often difficult to measure and can be very high. Before committing, set clear goals (e.g., number of qualified leads, on-site interviews) and track hires back to the event to justify the expense of time and money.
