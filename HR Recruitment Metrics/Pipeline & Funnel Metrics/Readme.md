### **Pipeline Velocity & Efficiency Metrics**

These metrics help you understand the speed and health of your recruitment funnel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Time to Fill** and **Time to Hire** are your top-level indicators of recruiting efficiency. A long Time to Fill can mean lost productivity, while a long Time to Hire can mean losing top candidates to faster competitors.

> [!TIP]
> Track **Time in Stage** alongside **Pass-Through Rates** to pinpoint exactly where candidates are getting stuck or leaving your pipeline. This is the first step to making improvements.

> [!CAUTION]
> A consistently high **Time to Start** can lead to **offer declinations** as candidates get cold feet or receive counter-offers. Keep new hires engaged between offer acceptance and their start date.

> [!NOTE]
> **Pipeline Velocity** is a composite metric. Improving your Pass-Through Rates and reducing your Time in Stage will directly increase your overall Pipeline Velocity.

### **Conversion & Stage Health Metrics**

These metrics measure the effectiveness of each stage of your recruitment funnel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Pass-Through Rate** and **Conversion Rate (per stage)** are the most direct measures of your hiring process's effectiveness. A low rate at any stage indicates a problem that needs diagnosis.

> [!WARNING]
> A low **Application Completion Rate** often points to a cumbersome, lengthy, or technically flawed application process. You are losing candidates before they even become applicants.

> [!NOTE]
> **Screening Rate** and **Interview Rate** are influenced by the quality of your applicants and the clarity of your job requirements. A very low Screening Rate may mean your job postings are attracting unqualified candidates.

> [!TIP]
> Calculate **Conversion Rates** from one stage to the next (e.g., Screen → Interview, Interview → Offer) to see the true yield of your process. This helps you forecast how many candidates you need at the top of the funnel to make one hire.

### **Diagnostic & Action-Oriented Metrics**

Use these metrics to diagnose problems and guide your recruitment strategy.

> [!WARNING]
> **Bottleneck Analysis** is critical. A stage with a suddenly growing **Time in Stage** and a falling **Pass-Through Rate** is a active bottleneck that is costing you time and candidates.

> [!CAUTION]
> A high **Application Rate** is meaningless without a healthy **Screening Rate**. A flood of unqualified applications can overwhelm recruiters and create a bottleneck, slowing down the entire process.

> [!TIP]
> Use **Bottleneck Analysis** to prioritize your efforts. Focus on improving the stage with the most significant candidate drop-off or the longest delay for the biggest impact on your overall recruiting success.
