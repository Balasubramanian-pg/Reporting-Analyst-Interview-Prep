### **Process Efficiency & Candidate Experience**

These metrics measure the speed, coordination, and completion of the interview cycle.

> [!WARNING]
> A long **Interview Scheduling Time** is a major candidate experience failure and a significant contributor to losing top talent to faster-moving competitors. It signals internal disorganization and a lack of respect for the candidate's time.

> [!CAUTION]
> A low **Interview Stage Completion Rate** (candidates dropping out mid-process) often points to an excessive number of interview rounds, poor communication, or disrespectful interviewer behavior. This wastes immense internal resources and damages your employer brand.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Interview Feedback Completion Rate** is a fundamental discipline. Slow or missing feedback creates bottlenecks, delays offers, and frustrates both candidates and hiring managers. This is a process hygiene metric that must be near 100%.

### **Assessment Quality & Accuracy**

These metrics evaluate the effectiveness and consistency of your interviewers and assessment methods.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Interviewer Effectiveness** is the cornerstone of quality hiring. An ineffective interviewer who consistently rejects good candidates or advances bad ones corrupts the entire hiring process and directly leads to high **Requisition Turnover**.

> [!TIP]
> Use an **Interview Calibration Score** to ensure consistency. If interviewers' scores for the same candidate vary wildly, your hiring criteria are unclear, your questions are poor, or interviewers need training. Calibration is key to fair and accurate assessments.

> [!NOTE]
> A low **Technical Assessment Pass Rate** could mean your assessments are too difficult, not aligned with the actual job, or that your recruiters are not effectively pre-screening candidates for the required skills.

### **Structural Integrity & Fairness**

These metrics focus on the design and equity of the interview process itself.

> [!WARNING]
> A low **Structured Interview Adoption** rate introduces significant bias and reduces predictive accuracy. Without standardized questions, interviews become inconsistent, unfair, and legally indefensible.

> [!TIP]
> Track **Panel Interview Diversity** to mitigate individual bias and improve candidate experience. A diverse panel signals an inclusive culture and provides varied perspectives on a candidate's fit.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Interview-to-Offer Ratio** helps gauge the selectivity and efficiency of your process. A very high ratio may indicate interviewers are too hesitant to make decisions, while a very low ratio could suggest the bar is too low or the process is too easy.
