Of course. Here is a breakdown of these operational and volume-based recruitment metrics, organized using your specified note system.

***

### **Funnel Health & Activity Volume**

These metrics provide a basic pulse on the volume and initial flow of candidates through your hiring process.

> [!NOTE]
> **Total Applications Received** is a basic top-of-funnel metric for gauging overall candidate interest and the reach of your job postings. However, it is a vanity metric if not paired with quality indicators like the **Screening Rate**.

> [!TIP]
> The **Applicant-to-Interview Ratio** is a key indicator of initial funnel efficiency. A very low ratio suggests your job postings may be attracting unqualified candidates, or your screening criteria are too lenient.

> [!NOTE]
> **Interviews Conducted** and **Phone Screens Completed** measure the activity volume of your recruiting and hiring manager team. These are leading indicators for future hires but do not guarantee quality outcomes.

### **Operational Load & Process Metrics**

These metrics focus on the internal workload and specific process steps.

> [!CAUTION]
> A high **Requisition Load Factor** without a corresponding increase in resources is a direct path to recruiter burnout, slower **Time to Fill**, and a decline in **Candidate Satisfaction** due to lack of attention.

> [!NOTE]
> **Assessments Administered** tracks the usage of your evaluation tools. A low number relative to interviews might indicate a process bottleneck or low adoption by hiring managers.

> [!TIP]
> Tracking **Candidate Touches** (emails, calls, messages) can help ensure a positive candidate experience. However, focus on the quality and timeliness of interactions rather than just the raw volume.
