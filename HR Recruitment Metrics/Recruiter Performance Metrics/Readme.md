### **Workload & Capacity Management**

These metrics help ensure your recruitment team is staffed appropriately and not at risk of burnout.

> [!WARNING]
> A high **Requisitions per Recruiter** count is the primary indicator of overload. This leads to slow **Time to Fill**, poor candidate communication, and recruiter burnout. It directly harms all other talent acquisition goals.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Recruiter Utilization Rate** measures active recruiting time against total capacity. A rate consistently near or over 100% is unsustainable and will lead to high recruiter turnover and declining quality of output.

> [!TIP]
> Balance **Requisitions per Recruiter** with role complexity. A recruiter handling 5 executive roles may be at capacity, while one handling 20 high-volume entry-level roles may be fine. Adjust workloads accordingly.

### **Productivity & Efficiency Metrics**

These metrics measure the output and efficiency of individual recruiters and the team.

> [!NOTE]
> **Hires per Recruiter** is a basic productivity metric, but it must be viewed in context. A high number could indicate easy-to-fill roles or a recruiter focused on volume over quality.

> [!TIP]
> The **Recruiter Efficiency Ratio** (hires relative to activities like calls, emails, screens) identifies your most strategic recruiters. Those with a high ratio are working smarter, not just harder, by focusing on high-yield activities.

> [!CAUTION]
> A low **Candidate Submissions per Requisition** rate can indicate either a difficult role or a recruiter struggling with effective sourcing. This is a key bottleneck that directly extends **Time to Fill**.

### **Quality & Effectiveness Metrics**

These metrics evaluate the *impact* and *outcomes* of a recruiter's work, beyond simple volume.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Quality of Hire by Recruiter** is the ultimate measure of a recruiter's effectiveness. It connects their work directly to business outcomes, showing whether they are sourcing and selecting candidates who become high performers.

> [!WARNING]
> A high **Interview-to-Hire Ratio by Recruiter** suggests a recruiter is not accurately assessing candidate fit before advancing them, wasting hiring manager time and slowing down the process for everyone.

> [!TIP]
> **Hiring Manager Satisfaction by Recruiter** is a leading indicator of partnership and trust. A dissatisfied hiring manager will circumvent the process, undermining your entire talent acquisition strategy. This metric is crucial for measuring recruiter effectiveness as a strategic advisor.

> [!NOTE]
> **Time to Fill by Recruiter** is useful for identifying process experts, but it should be balanced with **Quality of Hire**. The fastest recruiter may not be bringing you the best talent.
