### **Strategic Demand & Planning Metrics**

These metrics connect hiring activity to business strategy and forecasting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hiring Forecast Accuracy** is critical for resource allocation. A significant variance between projected and actual hiring needs leads to either recruiter overload or underutilization, and can stall business-critical projects.

> [!WARNING]
> A low **Critical Role Fill Rate** directly threatens business operations and strategic goals. These roles should be prioritized with dedicated resources, expedited processes, and specialized sourcing strategies.

> [!TIP]
> Analyze **Seasonal Hiring Patterns** to anticipate demand fluctuations. This allows for proactive recruiting, building talent pipelines in advance, and avoiding the inefficiency and high costs of reactive hiring.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Number of Open Requisitions** is a snapshot of current demand, but it must be viewed in the context of your team's capacity (**Requisitions per Recruiter**) to determine if the workload is sustainable.

### **Process Efficiency & Bottleneck Metrics**

These metrics identify internal delays and inefficiencies in initiating and managing open roles.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Requisition Approval Time** is a silent killer of hiring momentum. Long delays between identifying a need and approving the req mean you start the recruitment process late, increasing Time to Fill and the risk of losing top candidates to competitors.

> [!WARNING]
> **Aging Requisitions** (roles open beyond the target Time to Fill) are a major red flag. They indicate a hard-to-fill role, an inefficient process, or an uncompetitive offer strategy. They consume disproportionate recruiter time and often signify a broken process for that job type.

> [!TIP]
> Track **Requisition Withdrawal Rate**. A high rate suggests poor workforce planning, shifting business priorities, or managers posting "nice-to-have" roles. This wastes significant recruiter effort and damages credibility with candidates who applied.

### **Outcome & Quality of Process Metrics**

These metrics measure the effectiveness and long-term success of your hiring activities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Fill Rate** shows the overall success of your recruitment function in meeting the hiring demands of the business. A low fill rate indicates a fundamental inability to execute on the company's talent strategy.

> [!CAUTION]
> A high **Requisition Turnover** rate (positions reopened soon after being filled) is a severe warning sign. It indicates a failure in quality of hire, often due to poor assessment, misaligned expectations, or a bad onboarding experience, leading to wasted resources and repeated effort.

> [!NOTE]
> **Fill Rate** should be analyzed alongside **Quality of Hire** and **First-Year Attrition**. A high fill rate is meaningless if the new hires are low performers or leave quickly.
