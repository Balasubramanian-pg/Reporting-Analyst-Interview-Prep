### **Pre-Start Risk & Conversion Metrics**

These metrics focus on the critical period between offer acceptance and the first day, where risk of candidate drop-off is high.

> [!WARNING]
> A low **Offer-to-Start Conversion Rate** is a critical failure point that wastes all previous recruiting effort and investment. It often indicates issues with pre-boarding, counter-offers, or a poor candidate experience after acceptance.

> [!CAUTION]
> The **Background Check Failure Rate** represents a direct operational and reputational risk. Each failure is a rescinded offer, which can lead to legal disputes and severely damage your employer brand.

> [!TIP]
> **Pre-Boarding Engagement** is your primary tool for safeguarding the Offer-to-Start Conversion. Regular communication, paperwork completion, and social integration (e.g., team introductions) keep new hires excited and connected, reducing the chance of "ghosting."

### **Operational Readiness & Onboarding Efficiency**

These metrics measure how well the organization prepares for and executes the new hire's arrival.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Day 1 Readiness Score** is a direct reflection of operational efficiency and respect for the new hire. A poor experience (no computer, missing login) sets a negative tone, immediately increasing the risk of early attrition.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Onboarding Completion Rate** for required training (compliance, safety, systems) is a basic hygiene metric. Incomplete onboarding exposes the company to compliance risks and leaves the new hire unprepared.

> [!TIP]
> Use **New Hire 30/60/90 Day Check-ins** proactively. These structured touchpoints are not just for feedback; they are critical interventions to address early concerns, reinforce belonging, and improve **90-Day Retention**.

### **Impact & Productivity Metrics**

These metrics connect the onboarding process to the ultimate goal: a productive, retained employee.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Time to Full Productivity** is the ultimate measure of onboarding success. It directly quantifies the return on investment of your hiring process. A shorter ramp-up period means a faster contribution to business goals.

> [!WARNING]
> Ignoring the link between **Pre-Boarding Engagement**, **Day 1 Readiness**, and **Time to Full Productivity** is a strategic mistake. A disjointed or negative early experience can significantly extend the ramp-up time, costing the company in lost productivity.
