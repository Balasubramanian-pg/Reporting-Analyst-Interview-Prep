### **Legal & Regulatory Compliance Metrics**

These metrics are critical for avoiding legal penalties, government sanctions, and reputational damage.

> [!WARNING]
> **EEO Reporting Accuracy** is non-negotiable. Inaccurate reporting can lead to significant legal penalties, audits, and damage to your company's reputation. This is a foundational element of fair hiring practices.

> [!CAUTION]
> A poor **OFCCP Compliance Score** for government contractors can result in the loss of contracts, debarment from future bids, and mandatory corrective action plans. Compliance must be proactively managed, not reactively addressed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Data Privacy Compliance (GDPR, CCPA)** carries massive financial risks. Failure to properly handle candidate data, obtain consent, or honor data subject requests can result in fines amounting to millions of dollars and severe reputational harm.

### **Operational Risk & Process Integrity**

These metrics ensure the pre-employment screening process is efficient and effective.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Background Check Completion Rate** should trend near 100%. Any gap indicates a breakdown in the process where a candidate might start working before clearance, creating potential liability.

> [!TIP]
> Monitor **Background Check Turnaround Time** closely. Delays here are a major contributor to extending **Time to Start**, frustrating both the new hire and the hiring manager. Work with your vendor to optimize this.

> [!CAUTION]
> A low **Form I-9 Completion Rate** is a serious legal issue. Incomplete or inaccurate I-9 forms can result in hefty fines from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for every violation.

### **Screening & Risk Mitigation**

These metrics track the outcomes of your pre-employment screening checks.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Drug Test Pass Rate** provides insight into the candidate pool and the effectiveness of your pre-application communication regarding screening policies. A sudden drop may warrant investigation.

> [!WARNING]
> **Applicant Data Retention** is a critical component of data privacy and legal compliance. Keeping records too long violates GDPR/CCPA; not keeping them long enough violates EEO and OFCCP requirements. A clear, compliant records schedule is essential.
