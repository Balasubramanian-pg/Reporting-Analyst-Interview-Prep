### **Pipeline & Representation Metrics**

These metrics measure the flow and representation of diverse candidates through the hiring funnel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Diversity at Each Funnel Stage** is critical for diagnosing *where* in the process representation drops off. A diverse applicant pool that narrows significantly at the interview stage points to potential bias in screening or interviewing.

> [!WARNING]
> A lack of **Diversity of Applicant Pool** is a fundamental pipeline problem. If diverse candidates aren't applying, you cannot hire them. This indicates issues with your sourcing strategies, employer brand, or outreach.

> [!TIP]
> Track **Underrepresented Group Retention** alongside **Diversity of Hires**. Hiring diverse talent is only the first step; if they leave within the first year, it signals potential issues with inclusion, belonging, or equity in the onboarding experience and work environment.

> [!NOTE]
> **Diversity of Hires** is your ultimate outcome metric for representation goals, but it must be analyzed in the context of the entire funnel to be meaningful.

### **Fairness & Equity Analysis Metrics**

These metrics are used to audit the hiring process for bias and ensure equitable outcomes.

> [!WARNING]
> **Adverse Impact Analysis** is not just a best practice; it is a legal and compliance necessity. It statistically identifies if your selection process disproportionately and unfairly screens out members of a protected group.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Pay Equity by Hire** ensures fairness from day one. Inequitable starting salaries create long-term compounding disparities and expose the company to significant legal and reputational risk.

> [!CAUTION]
> A low **Demographic Parity Ratio** between stages (e.g., white candidates are advanced at a significantly higher rate than Black candidates) is a clear red flag for biased decision-making, flawed criteria, or non-inclusive practices that must be investigated immediately.

### **Process & Structural Intervention Metrics**

These metrics evaluate the specific actions and tools you are using to build a more equitable process.

> [!TIP]
> Use an **Inclusive Job Description Score** (via text analysis tools) to proactively remove biased language that can deter qualified diverse candidates from applying. This is a simple, high-impact lever to pull.

> [!NOTE]
> Tracking **Diverse Interview Panel Usage** helps ensure candidates meet with a variety of perspectives. More diverse panels can reduce individual interviewer bias and help candidates from all backgrounds feel more comfortable and represented.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Underrepresented Group Retention** is the true test of your company's inclusion, not just its hiring. A high attrition rate for any demographic group is a critical failure that outweighs successful hiring numbers and demands a deep cultural and managerial review.
