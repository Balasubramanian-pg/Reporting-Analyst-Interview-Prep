### **Brand Reach & Awareness Metrics**

These metrics measure the scale and recognition of your employer brand in the talent marketplace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Employer Brand Awareness** is the ultimate measure of your market presence. High awareness means top talent thinks of you first, reducing sourcing costs and creating a sustainable talent pipeline.

> [!WARNING]
> Stagnant **Social Media Following Growth** or low **Content Engagement Rate** indicates your employer brand messaging is not resonating. You are failing to capture the attention of passive candidates, which will increase your long-term cost and effort to hire.

> [!TIP]
> **Best Places to Work Rankings** provide powerful third-party validation that boosts credibility and attracts high-quality applicants. Actively pursuing and promoting these rankings is a high-impact branding activity.

> [!NOTE]
> **Career Page Traffic** is your top-of-funnel metric for direct candidates. While important, it must be paired with **Career Page Engagement** to determine if visitors are actually interested or just bouncing.

### **Engagement & Relationship Building**

These metrics focus on building deeper relationships with potential candidates beyond simple awareness.

> [!TIP]
> **Talent Network Growth Rate** is a leading indicator of future sourcing success. These are candidates who have explicitly opted in to hear from you, creating a warm, permission-based pipeline that is far more efficient than cold outreach.

> [!CAUTION]
> Low **Career Page Engagement** (high bounce rate, low time on site) means your careers site is failing to convert visitors into applicants. This is often due to poor content, a weak value proposition, or a non-mobile-friendly design.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Employee Advocacy Participation** is your most credible marketing channel. When employees share job posts and positive content, it reaches a wider, more trusted network and generates higher-quality applicants than corporate channels.

### **Strategic Pipeline & Channel Metrics**

These metrics evaluate long-term strategic initiatives for building talent communities.

> [!NOTE]
> **University Relations Pipeline** strength is critical for entry-level and early-career hiring. A strong program ensures a consistent flow of new talent and is a long-term investment in your future leadership pipeline.

> [!TIP]
> Measure **Content Engagement Rate** by tracking clicks, likes, shares, and comments on your employer brand content. This tells you what stories and messages resonate with your target talent audience, allowing you to refine your strategy.

> [!WARNING]
> Ignoring the **University Relations Pipeline** and **Talent Network Growth** in favor of only immediate, reactive sourcing is a strategic mistake. It leaves you without a talent bench and forces you to pay a premium to fill roles quickly.
