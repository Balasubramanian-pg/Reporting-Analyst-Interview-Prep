### **Strategic & Financial Health Metrics**

These metrics connect recruiting spend to broader business outcomes and financial planning.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Cost per Hire** is the foundational metric for understanding your total investment in acquiring talent. It is essential for budgeting and benchmarking against industry standards.

> [!TIP]
> Track **Cost by Source** rigorously. This tells you which channels (e.g., LinkedIn, job boards, referrals) deliver candidates most cost-effectively, allowing you to optimize your recruitment marketing spend.

> [!WARNING]
> A high **Agency Fee Percentage** can indicate an over-reliance on expensive external recruiters. This is a signal to invest in strengthening your internal recruiting capabilities and direct-sourcing strategies.

> [!NOTE]
> **Recruiting Budget as % of Revenue** provides a high-level view of the company's investment in talent acquisition relative to its size and is a key metric for leadership and financial planning.

### **Efficiency & Channel Analysis Metrics**

These metrics help you understand the cost-efficiency of your recruitment process and channels.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Cost per Quality Hire** is arguably the most meaningful cost metric. A low Cost per Hire is meaningless if the candidates don't perform. Adjusting for quality ensures you are investing in successful outcomes.

> [!CAUTION]
> A low **Cost per Application** can be misleading if it leads to a low **Screening Rate**. You may be attracting a high volume of unqualified applicants, which increases internal costs later in the funnel.

> [!TIP]
> Use **Cost per Interview** to gauge the efficiency of your mid-funnel process. A high cost here could indicate logistical inefficiencies, an excessive number of interview rounds, or a high cost of interviewer time.

> [!NOTE]
> Breaking down **Cost per Hire** into **Internal vs. External Costs** helps pinpoint where the money is going. A shift in this ratio can inform decisions about hiring more internal recruiters versus using agencies.

### **Operational & Technology Investment Metrics**

These metrics focus on the internal and technological investments in your recruitment function.

> [!NOTE]
> **Internal Cost per Hire** includes the pro-rated salaries, benefits, and overhead of your talent acquisition team. It's a measure of the internal resource investment required to make a hire.

> [!TIP]
> Monitor **Technology Cost per Hire** to ensure you are getting a good return on investment (ROI) from your recruiting software (ATS, sourcing tools, etc.). As this cost rises, you should see improvements in efficiency or quality.

> [!CAUTION]
> Ignoring **External Cost per Hire** can lead to budget overruns. These costs (job boards, advertising, agency fees) are often variable and can spike with high-volume hiring or hard-to-fill roles.
