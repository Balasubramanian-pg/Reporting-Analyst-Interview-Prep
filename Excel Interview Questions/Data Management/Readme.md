Here’s how you can create a **pivot table** in Excel to group the **Application Date** by month (or quarter) and analyze the trend of candidate applications over time:

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Create the Pivot Table**

#### **Step 1: Prepare Your Data**
- Ensure your data is in a structured table format with headers (as shown in your image).
- If your data isn’t already in a table, select the range and press `Ctrl + T` to convert it into a table.

#### **Step 2: Insert a Pivot Table**
1. Select any cell in your data range.
2. Go to the **Insert** tab in the Excel ribbon.
3. Click **PivotTable**.
4. In the dialog box that appears:
   - Choose **New Worksheet** or **Existing Worksheet** (to place the pivot table in a new or existing sheet).
   - Click **OK**.

#### **Step 3: Configure the Pivot Table**
1. In the **PivotTable Fields** pane (usually on the right side of the screen):
   - Drag the **Application Date** field to the **Rows** area.
   - Drag the **Candidate Name** (or **Candidate ID**) field to the **Values** area. This will count the number of applications.

2. Your pivot table will now show the **Application Date** and the **Count of Candidate Name** (or **Candidate ID**).

#### **Step 4: Group Dates by Month or Quarter**
1. Right-click on any date in the **Row Labels** section of the pivot table.
2. Select **Group**.
3. In the **Grouping** dialog box:
   - Choose **Months** (or **Quarters** if you prefer).
   - Click **OK**.

Your pivot table will now group the **Application Date** by month (or quarter) and show the count of applications for each period.

### **Example Pivot Table Output**
Here’s what your pivot table might look like after grouping by month:

| Row Labels   | Count of Candidate Name |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| February     | 4                       |
| March        | 5                       |
| Grand Total  | 9                       |

### **Step 5: Analyze the Trend**
- You can now see how many applications were received each month.
- To visualize the trend, you can create a **pivot chart**:
  1. Select the pivot table.
  2. Go to the **PivotTable Analyze** tab.
  3. Click **PivotChart**.
  4. Choose a **Column Chart** or **Line Chart** to visualize the trend over time.

### **Optional: Add Additional Fields**
- If you want to analyze trends by **Applied Position** or **Source**, you can add these fields to the **Columns** or **Filters** area of the pivot table.
- For example, drag **Applied Position** to the **Columns** area to see how many applications were received for each position per month.

### **Final Notes**
- If your data updates, you can **refresh the pivot table** by right-clicking it and selecting **Refresh**.
- This method is dynamic, so any changes to your data will automatically update the pivot table when refreshed.
