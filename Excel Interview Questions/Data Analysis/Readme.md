Let me break down the `COUNTIFS` formula in a simple and clear way so you can understand how it works.

---

### **What is the `COUNTIFS` Function?**
The `COUNTIFS` function in Excel counts the number of cells that meet **multiple criteria**. It is useful when you want to count items based on more than one condition.

---

### **Syntax of `COUNTIFS`**
```excel
=COUNTIFS(range1, criteria1, range2, criteria2, ...)
```
- **`range1`**: The first range of cells you want to evaluate.
- **`criteria1`**: The condition that cells in `range1` must meet.
- **`range2`**: The second range of cells you want to evaluate.
- **`criteria2`**: The condition that cells in `range2` must meet.
- You can add more ranges and criteria as needed.

### **Example Formula**
For your specific case, you want to count the number of candidates who are **"Hired"** for each **"Applied Position"**. Here's the formula for the **Marketing Manager** position:

```excel
=COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$C:$C, "Marketing Manager", 'Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired")
```

---

### **Breaking Down the Formula**
1. **`'Base DATA'!$C:$C`**:
   - This refers to the **Applied Position** column in the **Base DATA** sheet.
   - The formula checks each cell in this column to see if it contains the text **"Marketing Manager"**.

2. **`"Marketing Manager"`**:
   - This is the first condition. The formula looks for cells in column `C` that contain the exact text **"Marketing Manager"**.

3. **`'Base DATA'!$F:$F`**:
   - This refers to the **Interview Status** column in the **Base DATA** sheet.
   - The formula checks each cell in this column to see if it contains the text **"Hired"**.

4. **`"Hired"`**:
   - This is the second condition. The formula looks for cells in column `F` that contain the exact text **"Hired"**.

---

### **How Does It Work?**
The `COUNTIFS` function counts the number of rows where **both conditions** are true:
- The **Applied Position** is **"Marketing Manager"**.
- The **Interview Status** is **"Hired"**.

In simpler terms, it counts how many candidates are **both** Marketing Managers **and** have been Hired.

---

### **Example with Your Data**
| Candidate ID | Candidate Name | Applied Position   | Interview Status |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 101          | Alice Johnson  | Marketing Manager  | Rejected         |
| 102          | Bob Smith       | Marketing Manager  | Phone Screen     |
| 103          | Carol White     | Marketing Manager  | Interview Scheduled |
| **104**      | **David Lee**   | **Marketing Manager** | **Hired**        |
| 105          | Eva Green       | Marketing Manager  | Interview Scheduled |
| **107**      | **Grace Kim**   | **Marketing Manager** | **Hired**        |

The formula will count **2** rows (David Lee and Grace Kim) because they are the only ones who meet both conditions:
- Their **Applied Position** is **"Marketing Manager"**.
- Their **Interview Status** is **"Hired"**.

---

### **Dynamic Formula**
If you want to make the formula dynamic, you can reference the position name from another cell. For example, if the position name is in cell `B6`, you can use:

```excel
=COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$C:$C, B6, 'Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired")
```

- Here, `B6` contains the text **"Marketing Manager"**.
- The formula will count the number of candidates who are **Hired** for the position specified in cell `B6`.

---

### **Summary**
- The `COUNTIFS` function counts rows that meet **multiple conditions**.
- In your case, it counts candidates who are **Hired** for a specific **Applied Position**.
- You can use this formula for other positions by changing the position name or referencing different cells.
