To create a pivot table that groups dates by **fiscal year and fiscal quarters** (where Q1 is April-May-June and Q4 is January-February-March), you’ll need to follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Add Helper Columns for Fiscal Year and Fiscal Quarter**
Since Excel’s default grouping doesn’t support custom fiscal quarters, you’ll need to add two helper columns to your data:
1. **Fiscal Year**
2. **Fiscal Quarter**

#### **Fiscal Year Formula**
The fiscal year typically starts in April. For example:
- If the date is between **April 2024 and March 2025**, the fiscal year is **2025**.
- If the date is between **April 2025 and March 2026**, the fiscal year is **2026**.

Use this formula in a new column (e.g., **Fiscal Year**):
```excel
=IF(MONTH([@[Application Date]]) >= 4, YEAR([@[Application Date]]) + 1, YEAR([@[Application Date]]))
```
- This formula checks if the month is April (4) or later. If yes, it assigns the next year as the fiscal year. Otherwise, it uses the current year.

#### **Fiscal Quarter Formula**
Use this formula in another new column (e.g., **Fiscal Quarter**) to assign quarters based on your custom definition:
```excel
=CHOSE(MONTH([@[Application Date]]),
      "Q4", "Q4", "Q4",  // Jan, Feb, Mar = Q4
      "Q1", "Q1", "Q1",  // Apr, May, Jun = Q1
      "Q2", "Q2", "Q2",  // Jul, Aug, Sep = Q2
      "Q3", "Q3", "Q3"   // Oct, Nov, Dec = Q3
)
```
- This formula maps each month to the correct fiscal quarter.

### **Step 2: Insert a Pivot Table**
1. Select any cell in your data range.
2. Go to the **Insert** tab and click **PivotTable**.
3. Choose where to place the pivot table (new or existing worksheet) and click **OK**.

---

### **Step 3: Configure the Pivot Table**
1. In the **PivotTable Fields** pane:
   - Drag **Fiscal Year** to the **Rows** area.
   - Drag **Fiscal Quarter** to the **Columns** area.
   - Drag **Candidate Name** (or **Candidate ID**) to the **Values** area. This will count the number of applications.

2. Your pivot table will now show the count of applications grouped by **Fiscal Year** and **Fiscal Quarter**.

### **Example Pivot Table Output**
Here’s what your pivot table might look like:



| Row Labels (Fiscal Year) | Q4  | Q1  | Q2  | Q3  | Grand Total |
|--------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------------|
| 2025                     | 3   | 4   | 1   | 1   | 9           |
| 2026                     | -   | -   | -   | -   | -           |

### **Step 4: Create a Pivot Chart (Optional)**
To visualize the trend:
1. Select the pivot table.
2. Go to the **PivotTable Analyze** tab and click **PivotChart**.
3. Choose a **Column Chart** or **Line Chart** to show the trend of applications over fiscal quarters and years.

---

### **Step 5: Refresh the Pivot Table**
If your data changes, right-click the pivot table and select **Refresh** to update the results.

---

### **Summary**
- You added two helper columns (**Fiscal Year** and **Fiscal Quarter**) to categorize dates according to your fiscal calendar.
- You created a pivot table to group and count applications by **Fiscal Year** and **Fiscal Quarter**.
- Optionally, you can visualize the data using a pivot chart.
