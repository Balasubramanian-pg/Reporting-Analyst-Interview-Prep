You're absolutely right. Comparing quarters with incomplete data (missing one month in Q1 and Q3) can lead to misleading conclusions. Let’s address this by normalizing the data and applying statistical techniques to make the comparison valid.

---

### **Step 1: Normalize the Data**
Since Q1 and Q3 are missing one month each, we can **annualize the data** to make it comparable. This means we'll calculate the average monthly hiring rate and then project it for a full quarter (3 months).

#### **Current Data (Hiring Counts)**
- February: 4
- March: 11
- April: 10
- May: 10
- June: 10
- July: 11
- August: 10
- September: 10
- October: 10
- November: 14

#### **Quarters and Missing Months**
- **Q1 (April-June)**: Missing January.
- **Q2 (July-September)**: Complete.
- **Q3 (October-December)**: Missing December.
- **Q4 (January-March)**: Missing January (but we have February and March).

Since the fiscal quarters are defined differently (Q1: April-June, Q2: July-September, Q3: October-December, Q4: January-March), let's adjust our approach to match this.

### **Step 2: Calculate Monthly Averages and Project Full Quarters**
We'll calculate the average hiring per month for each quarter and then multiply by 3 to estimate the total hiring for a full quarter.

#### **QTR1 (April-June)**
- April: 10
- May: 10
- June: 10
- **Average Monthly Hiring**: (10 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 10
- **Projected Total for QTR1**: 10 * 3 = 30

#### **QTR2 (July-September)**
- July: 11
- August: 10
- September: 10
- **Average Monthly Hiring**: (11 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 10.33
- **Projected Total for QTR2**: 10.33 * 3 ≈ 31

#### **QTR3 (October-December)**
- October: 10
- November: 14
- December: Missing
- **Average Monthly Hiring**: (10 + 14) / 2 = 12
- **Projected Total for QTR3**: 12 * 3 = 36

#### **QTR4 (January-March)**
- January: Missing
- February: 4
- March: 11
- **Average Monthly Hiring**: (4 + 11) / 2 = 7.5
- **Projected Total for QTR4**: 7.5 * 3 = 22.5

### **Step 3: Statistical Analysis**
Now that we have projected totals, let's analyze the trend.



| Quarter | Projected Total Hiring |
|---------|-------------------------|
| QTR1    | 30                      |
| QTR2    | 31                      |
| QTR3    | 36                      |
| QTR4    | 22.5                    |

#### **Trend Analysis**
- **QTR1 to QTR2**: Slight increase from 30 to 31 hires (3.3% increase).
- **QTR2 to QTR3**: Noticeable increase from 31 to 36 hires (16.1% increase).
- **QTR3 to QTR4**: Significant decrease from 36 to 22.5 hires (37.5% decrease).

#### **Statistical Observations**
- **Growth in QTR3**: The increase in QTR3 suggests a peak hiring period, potentially due to year-end business demands or budget utilization.
- **Decline in QTR4**: The significant drop in QTR4 could be attributed to the beginning of a new fiscal year where hiring budgets might be reset or lower initial allocations.

---

### **Step 4: Visualizing the Normalized Trend**
To better visualize the trend, you can create a bar or line chart using the projected totals for each quarter.

#### **Example Chart Description**
- **X-axis**: Fiscal Quarters (QTR1, QTR2, QTR3, QTR4)
- **Y-axis**: Projected Total Hiring
- **Trend Line**: Shows the increase from QTR1 to QTR3 and the drop in QTR4.

### **Step 5: Further Statistical Insights**
#### **Variance and Standard Deviation**
- Calculate the variance and standard deviation to understand the volatility in hiring across quarters.

#### **Moving Averages**
- Use moving averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.

#### **Correlation Analysis**
- If you have additional data (e.g., revenue, business growth), you can perform a correlation analysis to see if hiring trends align with other business metrics.

---

### **Conclusion**
By normalizing the data and projecting full quarters, we can make a more accurate and fair comparison. The trend shows a peak in hiring during QTR3, followed by a decline in QTR4. This analysis can help in planning recruitment strategies and budget allocations more effectively.
