The issue with your current formula is likely due to the range references and the structure of the `COUNTIFS` function. Let's break down the correct approach to achieve the desired result.

### Problem Analysis
You want to count the number of candidates with an **Interview Status of "Hired"** for each **Applied Position** (e.g., Data Analyst, HR Manager, etc.).

### Correct Formula
The correct formula for cell `C4` (Data Analyst) should be:

```excel
=COUNTIFS(
   'Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired",
   'Base DATA'!$A:$A, "Data Analyst"
)
```

#### Explanation:
- **`'Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired"`**: This checks the **Interview Status** column (`F`) for the value **"Hired"**.
- **`'Base DATA'!$A:$A, "Data Analyst"`**: This checks the **Applied Position** column (`A`) for the value **"Data Analyst"**.

### Steps to Apply the Formula
1. **For Data Analyst (Cell `C4`)**:
   ```excel
   =COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired", 'Base DATA'!$A:$A, "Data Analyst")
   ```

2. **For HR Manager (Cell `C5`)**:
   ```excel
   =COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired", 'Base DATA'!$A:$A, "HR Manager")
   ```

3. **For Marketing Manager (Cell `C6`)**:
   ```excel
   =COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired", 'Base DATA'!$A:$A, "Marketing Manager")
   ```

4. **For Software Engineer (Cell `C7`)**:
   ```excel
   =COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired", 'Base DATA'!$A:$A, "Software Engineer")
   ```

### Why Your Formula Didn't Work
- Your formula references `Question 2` and uses ranges like `$C$2:$C$101` and `$F$2:$F$101`, which are incorrect for this context. The `COUNTIFS` function should reference the **Applied Position** column (`A`) and the **Interview Status** column (`F`) in the **Base DATA** sheet.

### Additional Tips
- Ensure that the **Applied Position** values in the `Base DATA` sheet match exactly with the labels in your summary table (e.g., "Data Analyst" vs. "Data analyst").
- If you want to make the formula dynamic, you can reference the position names from the cells in column `B` (e.g., `B4`, `B5`, etc.) instead of hardcoding them. For example:
  ```excel
  =COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired", 'Base DATA'!$A:$A, B4)
  ```


The issue is likely due to the way the formula is referencing the data. Based on the image you shared, the **Applied Position** column is `C`, and the **Interview Status** column is `F`. Let's correct the formula to match the structure of your data.

### Correct Formula
To count the number of candidates with an **Interview Status of "Hired"** for each **Applied Position**, use the following formula:

#### For Marketing Manager (Cell `C4`):
```excel
=COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$C:$C, "Marketing Manager", 'Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired")
```

### Explanation:
- **`'Base DATA'!$C:$C, "Marketing Manager"`**: This checks the **Applied Position** column (`C`) for the value **"Marketing Manager"**.
- **`'Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired"`**: This checks the **Interview Status** column (`F`) for the value **"Hired"**.

### Steps to Apply the Formula:
1. **For Data Analyst (Cell `C4`)**:
   ```excel
   =COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$C:$C, "Data Analyst", 'Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired")
   ```

2. **For HR Manager (Cell `C5`)**:
   ```excel
   =COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$C:$C, "HR Manager", 'Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired")
   ```

3. **For Marketing Manager (Cell `C6`)**:
   ```excel
   =COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$C:$C, "Marketing Manager", 'Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired")
   ```

4. **For Software Engineer (Cell `C7`)**:
   ```excel
   =COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$C:$C, "Software Engineer", 'Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired")
   ```

### Dynamic Formula:
If you want to make the formula dynamic by referencing the position names from column `B`, you can use:
```excel
=COUNTIFS('Base DATA'!$C:$C, B4, 'Base DATA'!$F:$F, "Hired")
```
Then, drag this formula down to apply it to the other positions.

### Verifying the Data:
From the image you shared, here are the candidates with the **Interview Status of "Hired"** for the **Marketing Manager** position:
- David Lee (Candidate ID: 104)
- Grace Kim (Candidate ID: 107)

So, the count for **Marketing Manager** should be **2**.

### Troubleshooting:
- Ensure that the **Applied Position** and **Interview Status** columns are correctly referenced.
- Double-check for any extra spaces or inconsistencies in the data (e.g., "Marketing Manager" vs "Marketing manager").
- Make sure the sheet name `'Base DATA'` is correctly referenced in the formula. If the sheet name contains spaces or special characters, it should be enclosed in single quotes.
